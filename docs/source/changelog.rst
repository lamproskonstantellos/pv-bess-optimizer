0.6.0 (2026-05-07)
------------------

Feature pack — see ``docs/v0.6_changelog.md`` for the full as-built
diff and the five-line v0.5 → v0.6 migration summary.

* **Workbook schema (breaking)** — the ``project`` sheet's
  ``# system`` group splits into ``# system_sizing`` (capacities and
  power limits) and ``# bess_operation`` (efficiency, SOC bounds,
  cycle limit).  The ``# optimization`` group is removed entirely:
  solver gap / time limit are CLI-only (``--mip-gap`` /
  ``--time-limit``); the curtail-tiebreaker and cycles-bonus weights
  become module-level constants in :mod:`pvbess_opt.optimization`.
  The ``economic`` sheet adds an ``# uncertainty`` group (11 keys)
  and renames ``plot_daily_year1`` (bool) to ``plot_daily_scope``
  (``none`` | ``year1_only`` | ``all``).  ``plot_yearly_scope`` is
  widened to the same vocabulary.  Legacy v0.5 keys produce explicit
  WARNINGs and are ignored — no silent translation.
* **Year-0 / Year-1 calendar split** — Year 0 (CAPEX) lands at
  calendar ``project_start_year - 1``; Year 1 at
  ``project_start_year``.  A 20-year run with
  ``project_start_year = 2026`` produces 21 cashflow rows: 2025
  (CAPEX only) + 2026..2045.  New ``capex_year`` financial KPI.
* **Three asset modes** — ``pv_nameplate_kwp = 0`` means PV is not
  part of the project; ``bess_power_kw = 0`` means BESS is not part
  of the project; both zero raises ``ValueError``.  The optimizer
  pins absent-asset variables to zero and skips the corresponding
  constraint blocks.
* **Workbook-driven uncertainty + 4-source compare** — the new
  ``# uncertainty`` group drives rolling-horizon Monte Carlo.  Set
  ``uncertainty_compare_sources = TRUE`` to run four ensembles
  (DAM-only, PV-only, Load-only, All-combined), emit a
  comparison plot plus four P50 KPI keys, and produce the new
  ``rolling_horizon_compare_mc`` sheet on ``03_results.xlsx``.
* **Unified plot scopes** — ``plot_daily_scope``,
  ``plot_monthly_scope``, ``plot_yearly_scope`` all accept
  ``none`` | ``year1_only`` | ``all``.
* **Merchant-mode plot trio** — new dispatch / SOC / revenue plots
  per resolution replace the empty supply / surplus / combined plots
  in merchant mode.
* **New financial KPIs** — ``lcoe_eur_per_mwh``, ``lcos_eur_per_mwh``,
  ``pv_capacity_factor``, ``bess_lifetime_cycles``, plus five Year-1
  revenue-breakdown keys.  Three new lifecycle plots:
  ``revenue_stack_yearly``, ``lifetime_cycles``,
  ``lcoe_lcos_summary``.
* **Documentation** — new
  ``docs/technical.documentation/uncertainty_modelling.md`` and
  ``asset_modes.md``.  README badge row reordered to
  license → version → python → CI.

0.5.0 (2026-05-06)
------------------

Initial release.

* Three-sheet input schema (``timeseries`` / ``project`` / ``economic``)
  with separator-row support.
* Two regulatory regimes: ``vnb`` (Greek Virtual Net Billing with co-
  located load) and ``merchant`` (pure utility-scale dispatch, no
  co-located load).
* Hard static curtailment cap on grid-bound flows in **both** modes per
  **MD YPEN/DAPEEK/53563/1556/2023** (27 % distribution-connected, 28 %
  transmission-connected).
* Single ``profit`` objective (see ``technical.documentation/objectives``
  for the reasoning).
* Tight per-instance big-M MILP formulation; binary-free slack-based
  load priority in ``vnb``.
* 8 audit invariants exposed via
  :func:`pvbess_opt.optimization.verify_dispatch_invariants`.
* Multi-year project-finance pipeline: cashflow projection, NPV / IRR /
  ROI / BCR / simple+discounted payback, four-driver tornado sensitivity.
* HOMER / Gridcog / Aurora calendar convention (Year 0 and Year 1 share
  the same calendar year).
* Single ``02_dispatch/dispatch_hourly.xlsx`` with one sheet per calendar
  year.
* Rolling-horizon dispatch with imperfect foresight + Monte Carlo over
  forecast scenarios.  Defaults: 48-hour window, 24-hour commit,
  log-normal noise on DAM (sigma=0.20), PV (sigma=0.12), load
  (sigma=0.05).
* IEEE-styled PDF plots (energy + financial + rolling-horizon
  distribution).  Compact EUR formatter (``EUR 12.3M``) on every
  financial axis.
