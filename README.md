Mixed-integer linear programming model for PV + BESS sizing and 15-minute
dispatch, with a multi-year project-finance pipeline and rolling-horizon
Monte Carlo for uncertainty analysis.

Two regulatory regimes and three asset modes are supported:

* `vnb` — co-located load with self-consumption priority.  Load
  balance enforces a hard PV→load priority, surplus-only export
  through a binary-free slack, and no simultaneous grid I/O via a
  tight big-M.  Self-consumption is settled at the retail tariff;
  surplus is settled per applicable settlement rules at the
  day-ahead market price.
* `merchant` — pure utility-scale dispatch with **no co-located load**.
  PV and BESS dispatch entirely to the day-ahead market.  The hourly
  static curtailment cap on grid-bound flows still applies and is
  supplied by the user through the `curtailment_profile` sheet, in
  line with the applicable grid-connection regulations.

The asset mode is read literally from the workbook — set
`pv_nameplate_kwp = 0` for a BESS-only project, `bess_power_kw = 0`
for a PV-only project, both > 0 for a hybrid PV+BESS project.

The codebase is pure Python and runs on **Linux, macOS, and Windows** with
Python ≥ 3.11.  All plots are exported as IEEE-styled PDFs.

The package keeps a flat module layout (≤ 12 top-level modules; see
`CONTRIBUTING.md`).  Once the count crosses 12 we will subpackage by
responsibility (`solve/`, `finance/`, `uncertainty/`, `plotting/`).

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt           # base + solvers + linters + pytest
python main.py inputs/input.xlsx --solver highs
```

A run produces, under `results/<input>_<scenario>_<timestamp>/`:

```
00_summary/        SUMMARY.md, run_log.txt
01_inputs/         input_snapshot.xlsx, assumptions_summary.txt
02_dispatch/       dispatch_hourly.xlsx (one sheet per calendar year)
03_results.xlsx    KPIs, cashflows, financial KPIs, sensitivity, rolling-horizon MC
04_financial_plots/ cumulative, waterfall, payback, tornados, rolling_horizon_distribution

```

## Workbook schema

Seven themed sheets:

* **`timeseries`** — per-step data: `timestamp`, `load_kwh` (required
  for `vnb`, optional for `merchant`), `pv_kwh`,
  `dam_price_eur_per_mwh`, optional `retail_price_eur_per_mwh`.
  Case-study fixture is 35 040 rows at 15-minute cadence (one full
  year); the MILP timestep is auto-detected.
* **`project`** — high-level run config:
  `project_lifecycle_years`, `project_start_year`, `mode`,
  `settlement_minutes`, `p_grid_export_max_kw` (project-wide grid
  export limit applied to the combined PV + BESS flow),
  `retail_tariff_eur_per_mwh`, `allow_bess_grid_charging`,
  `unavailability_pct` (user-configurable post-solve derate),
  `currency_format`, `show_titles`.
* **`pv`** — `pv_nameplate_kwp`, `specific_production_kwh_per_kwp`,
  `pv_degradation_year1_pct`, `pv_degradation_annual_pct`,
  `capex_pv_eur_per_kw`, `devex_pv_eur_per_kw`, `opex_pv_eur_per_kwp`.
* **`bess`** — `bess_power_kw` (symmetric charge / discharge limit),
  `bess_capacity_kwh` (pinned), efficiency / SOC bounds / cycle cap,
  `capex_bess_eur_per_kw`, `devex_bess_eur_per_kw`,
  `opex_bess_eur_per_kw`, `bess_replacement_year`,
  `bess_replacement_cost_pct`, `bess_degradation_annual_pct`.
* **`economics`** — `discount_rate_pct`, `opex_inflation_pct`,
  `retail_inflation_pct` (user-set annual indexation of the retail
  tariff / PPA revenue; default 0 = no indexation),
  `dam_inflation_pct` (annual indexation of wholesale exports;
  default 0), `aggregator_fee_pct_revenue` (user-configurable
  fraction of gross revenue retained by the aggregator),
  `sensitivity_*` (5 keys), four `benchmark_*` keys for the Lazard
  LCOE / LCOS bands.
* **`simulation`** — `uncertainty_*` (11 keys), `plot_daily_scope` /
  `plot_monthly_scope` / `plot_yearly_scope` ∈
  `none | year1_only | all`.
* **`curtailment_profile`** — user-configurable hourly cap profile.
  24 hourly rows × 1 col (`curtailment_pct`) for a constant-by-month
  cap, or 24 rows × 12 cols (`curtailment_pct_jan` …
  `curtailment_pct_dec`) for a per-month hour-of-day cap.  Missing
  sheet ⇒ the loader falls back to a flat default.

### How the export cap is enforced

The per-step grid-export cap is computed as
`p_grid_export_max_kw × dt_h × (1 − curtailment_fraction)` and
applied to the **combined** PV + BESS export flow
(`grid_export_total[t] = pv_to_grid[t] + bess_dis_grid[t]`), not
separately to PV exports or BESS-discharge exports.
`p_grid_export_max_kw` is the nameplate grid-connection limit;
`curtailment_profile` is the per-hour regulatory derate that scales
the nameplate down for that step.  The same cap applies in both
`vnb` and `merchant` modes.

Setting `pv_nameplate_kwp = 0` makes the project BESS-only;
`bess_power_kw = 0` makes it PV-only; both > 0 ⇒ hybrid.  Setting both
to zero raises `ValueError` from `read_inputs`.

See `docs/source/users.guide/inputs.rst` for the full reference and
`docs/technical.documentation/uncertainty_modelling.md` plus
`docs/technical.documentation/asset_modes.md` for the technical
notes.

## CLI

```bash
# Single perfect-foresight solve
python main.py inputs/input.xlsx --solver highs

# Override mode (workbook says vnb; force merchant)
python main.py inputs/input.xlsx --mode merchant --solver highs

# Rolling-horizon with Monte Carlo (imperfect foresight + 30 seeds)
python main.py inputs/input.xlsx \
    --rolling-horizon \
    --window-hours 48 \
    --commit-hours 24 \
    --monte-carlo 30 \
    --seed 42 \
    --solver highs

# Strict mode: dispatch-invariant violations error out
python main.py inputs/input.xlsx --strict --solver highs
```

The `--strict` flag turns the nine dispatch invariants from warnings into
errors.  See `docs/source/technical.documentation/mip_formulation.rst` for
the invariant set.

## Objective

Single objective: **profit maximisation**.  When the user's retail
tariff exceeds the DAM price in the majority of hours (the typical
case for `vnb` projects with a co-located load), the profit
objective produces the same dispatch as a "green" objective —
self-consumption emerges from the economics rather than being a
hard constraint.  The hard `LOAD_PV_PRIORITY` constraint still pins
`pv_to_load[t] == min(pv[t], load[t])` exactly (Section 2 of the
spec) so the dispatch is correct for any retail / DAM ratio the user
supplies.  In `merchant` mode there is no load to "be green about"
in the first place.  See
`docs/source/technical.documentation/objectives.rst` for the full
reasoning.

## Rolling horizon (uncertainty)

A single annual MILP with full visibility into every hour's DAM price,
PV output, and load is a **perfect-foresight** model — it produces an
upper bound on achievable profit, not a realistic operating result.

`pvbess_opt.rolling_horizon` adds:

* sliding-window MILP with imperfect foresight beyond the commit horizon;
* SOC carryover across windows (no closed-cycle constraint within a window);
* KPI re-evaluation against the original (noise-free) timeseries;
* Monte Carlo over forecast scenarios with reproducible seeds;
* P10 / P50 / P90 distribution + foresight-gap reporting.

Forecast-noise sigmas (defensible from literature):

| Variable      | sigma        | Source                                       |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| DAM price     | 0.20 (MAPE)  | ENTSO-E D+1 benchmark                        |
| PV generation | 0.12 (RMSE)  | NREL day-ahead PV forecast study             |
| Load          | 0.05 (MAPE)  | Predictable-customer benchmark               |

See `docs/source/users.guide/rolling_horizon.rst` for the full guide.
